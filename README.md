# Todo App
This is a simple yet effective Todo List application built with React and Vite. The app allows users to manage their tasks and persists their todo items using localStorage, ensuring that items remain saved even if the user navigates away or closes the browser.

## Features
* Task Management: Add, delete and check 'done' tasks to keep track of your to-do list.
* Persistent Storage: Uses localStorage to remember your todo items across sessions, so your tasks are preserved even if you leave the page or close the browser.
* React & Vite: Built with React and Vite for fast development and build times.

## Technologies Used
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* Vite: A modern build tool for faster development and optimized production builds.
* JavaScript: The primary programming language used.
* CSS: For styling the application.
* HTML: For the structure of the app.

## What I Would Change If I Had More Time
* User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to have personalized and secure access to their own todo lists. This would involve adding login and registration functionality and managing user sessions.
* Task Categorization: Add categories or tags for tasks to help users organize their todos more effectively. This could include features for filtering and sorting tasks based on their categories.
